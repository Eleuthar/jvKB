primitive VS object VS reference
=================================

* primitives cannot be assigned null value

* when not null, references can be used to call methods

* all objects are accessed by reference, there is never direct access to the object itself

* all objects inherit java.lang.Object

* the type of object determine which properties exist within the object in memory

* the type of reference to the object determine which methods and variables are accessible to the Java program




Casting objects
===============

* casting object from subclass to a superclass doesn't require explicit cast

* casting object from superclass to subclass requires explicit cast

* compiler will not allow casts to unrelated type

* exception may be thrown at runtime if object being cast is not actually an instance of that class




Numeric promotion rulez
========================

* if 2 values have different data types, the Java will auto-promote 1 of the values to the larger of the 2 data types

* on integer vs float, int will be converted to float

* smaller of 2 data types, is promoted to the larger




ArrayList
===========

* If you call remove(0) using an empty ArrayList object, it will compile successfully.

* arrays || arrayLists with same content are not equal

* array converted to list keeps a mutual change link and the list has fixed size.




Wrapper class
==============

* used in Autoboxing: each primitive has a Wrapper class that is converted to, in order to be stored in ArrayList (it only uses classes)

* Wrapper methods: parseType returns primitive, valueOf returns Wrapper, as long as the parameter is valid; except Character

* in overloaded methods, only one conversion is allowed to reach the parameter type in method definition: primitive > larger type > autoboxed type > varargs




Switch statement
================

* switch parameter must be: int\byte\short\char\string\enum

* the case value must be compile-time constant value of the same data type as the switch parameter: literal || final constant var XOR enum




for loop
=========

* variables in initialization block must be the same data type, no redeclaration of the type allowed.




DateTime
=========

LocalDate.now();
LocalDateTime.now();
LocalDate.of(y, m, d)
LocalTime.of(h, m, s, nanos)
LocalDate.of(YYYY, Month.<month>, d);
LocalDateTime.of(date, time)
LocalDate.plusDays\Weeks\Months\Years(int);
LocalDateTime.minusDays\Hours\Seconds(int);
Collections.Period
date.getDayOfWeek\Month\Year\DayOfYear();
LocalDate.parse("<pattern>", <DateTimeFormatter var>);
LocalTime.parse("<valid Time>");




DateTime formatting
====================

date.format(DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE);

time.format(DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_TIME);

datetime.format(DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME);

DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDate(FormatStyle.SHORT\MEDIUM); .format(dateTime\date\NOTtime);

DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("MMMM dd, yyyy, hh:mm");




Method
=======

* method overloading
    - same method with diferent parameters
    - allows changing the return type

* method overriding
    - child method with the same signature of the parent, with at least the same accessibility
    - can make use of "super." call to parent method in specific cases
    - child method cannot throw an exception that is new or broader than the class of any exception thrown in the parent class method
    - if the method returns a value it must be the same or a subclass of the method in the parent class == covariant return type

* method hiding is overriding applied to static method only




Interface
==========

* Abstract data type that defines a list of abstract public methods

* Can include a list of constant variables and default methods, if keywords public and\or abstract are not provided, the compiler will automatically insert them as part of definition

* Public or default access only, no private or final

* only an interface can extend an interface

* an abstract class can implement an interface without overriding interface methods, until the first concrete class

* a class inheriting from multiple interfaces that contain:
	- the same method, will implement the latter method.
	- the same method with different signature, there is no conflict == overloading
	- the same method and signature but different return type, will not compile due to conflicting interfaces

* interface variables are assumed to be static and final, other keyword and modifier will trigger compiler error; if missing, the compiler will automatically insert public static final to any interface variable

* the name of an interface variable must be defined with uppercase letters and the value must be set when it is declared, due to final keyword

* instantiating an interface creates an instance of an anonymous inner class implementer of that interface: Interface x = new Interface() { //implementation };

* interface can be instantiated using a class instance which defines the abstract method


	Interface Default Method
	`````````````````````````

* can provide "default" method with method body which in the end achieves backward compatibility with the existing codebase

* default interface method must be marked only as "public default", as it may be overridden by a class that implements the interface; "public default" is not assumed or added automatically by the compiler

* an interface extending another interface can redeclare default method as abstract, requiring classes that implement the new interface to explicitly provide a method body

* inheriting multiple identical default methods is allowed only if the subclass overrides the method.


	Interface Static Method
	````````````````````````

*  is not inherited in classes that implement the interface, but is accessible without instance of the interface: "ifName.staticMethod()"

* is assumed by compiler to be public, will not compile if marked as private or protected
