Object vs reference
====================
* all references have the same size, no matter the type

* objects sit on heap and have no name, only reference to it

* an object remains in heap until it is no longer reachable:
    1. no reference points to it
    2. all references to the object have gone out of scope


Methods
========
* System.gc() can be ignored by Java, not guaranteed to free heap.

* finalize() is called if the garbage collector tries to collect the object. If GC fails, this method is not called twice.
